1. Kernel – the brain
It talks directly to hardware.
It controls CPU, memory, disk, network and processes.
Apps never touch hardware directly — kernel does it for them.

2. User Space – where we work
This is where commands and apps run (bash, docker, nginx, python).
When we run a command, it asks the kernel for resources.

3. systemd (PID 1) – the starter/manager
When the system boots, systemd starts everything: ssh, docker, nginx, network etc.
Without it, the server would start with nothing running.

How Processes Work

When we run a command like:

python app.py


Linux:

Creates a process

Gives it a PID

Assigns CPU & memory

Process states:

Running → using CPU

Sleeping → waiting

Stopped → paused

Zombie → finished but not cleared

Useful commands:

ps
top
kill

Why systemd is Important

systemd manages services automatically.

Example:

systemctl start nginx
systemctl enable nginx
systemctl status nginx


So when server restarts → services come back automatically.
This is critical in DevOps because servers must recover without manual work.

In simple words:

Kernel = controls hardware
User space = runs apps
systemd = starts and manages services

Understanding this helps us debug server issues faster.
